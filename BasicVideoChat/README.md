# Basic Video Chat sample

This sample application shows how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish a stream, and subscribe to multiple streams for both iOS and Android using the OpenTok React Native SDK.

*Note:* This version of the sample is used to test end-to-end encryption API enhancement. It loads opentok-react-native from the e2ee branch. 

## Setup

1. Install the required node modules: `npm install`

2. For iOS, install the Podfile's dependencies: `cd ios/ && pod install`

3. Run the the [test web app](../Test web app/) to create an E2EE session.

4. In the App.js file, set the `apiKey`, `sessionId`, and `token` properties. Use the session ID and a token generated by the test web app.

5. Click the buttons at the bottom of the app to change the encryption secret used. The valid secret is "testSecrt". The invalid secret is "1" (which is too short). The non-matching secret is "test" concatenated with a random number string.

For testing, you can use the [test web app](../Test web app/) to create sessions, publish streams from a web client, and subscribe to streams published from the client using the OpenTok React Native SDK.
